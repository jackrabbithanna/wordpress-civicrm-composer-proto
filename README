# Composer Wordpress/CiviCRM prototype

When this PR is merged: https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-wordpress/pull/347
We can remove the dependency on my fork of civicrm-wordpress in this repo.

# Fresh Install

clone this repo
cd [repo]
composer install

copy ./wp-config.php to wp-config.bak
copy ./web/wp-content/uploads/civicrm/civicrm.settings.php to civicrm.settings.bak

Create a .env file with all the necessary environmental variables, .env-example provided

Install Wordpress as normal

copy ./wp-config.bak to ./wp-config.php

Remove ./web/wp-config.php after login so that ./wp-config.php takes over

Install CiviCRM as normal

copy ./web/wp-content/uploads/civicrm/civicrm.settings.bak to civicrm.settings.php

Now both wp-config.php and civicrm.settings.php are the originals from this repo, using the environmental variables in the .env
